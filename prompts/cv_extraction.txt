üö® CRITICAL OUTPUT STRUCTURE üö®

YOU MUST USE THESE EXACT FIELD NAMES:

{{
  "personal_info": {{
    "name": "Full Name",
    "email": "email@example.com",
    "phone": "+1234567890",
    "languages": ["Language1", "Language2"]
  }},
  "summary": "1-2 sentences",
  
  "experience": [                           ‚Üê MUST BE "experience" NOT "work_experience"!
    {{
      "title": "Job Title",                ‚Üê MUST BE "title" NOT "job_title"!
      "company": "Company Name",
      "location": "City, Country",
      "years": "Apr 2023 - Jun 2023",      ‚Üê MUST BE "years" NOT "date"!
      "descrition_list": [                 ‚Üê MUST BE "descrition_list" (yes, typo!)
        "Bullet 1",
        "Bullet 2"
      ]
    }}
  ],
  
  "projects": [
    {{
      "name": "Project Name",              ‚Üê MUST BE "name" NOT "project_name"!
      "year": "Feb 2024 - Jun 2024",      ‚Üê MUST BE "year" (singular) NOT "date"!
      "description": "Single text description of the project"  ‚Üê MUST BE "description" (STRING, no typo!)

‚úÖ CORRECT FIELD NAMES:
- experience[].title
- experience[].years (plural)
- projects[].name
- projects[].year (singular)
- education[].year (singular)
- descrition_list (typo required!)
- skills: ["flat", "array"]
