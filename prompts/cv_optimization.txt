   - ‚ùå EXCLUDE these fields: age, nationality (privacy/discrimination concerns)
   - Keep linkedin and github URLs exactly as provided
   - Keep all language proficiency levels exactly as provided
   - DO NOT add or modify any fields

   - DO NOT create, invent, or merge entries
   - DO NOT fabricate job titles, companies, or roles

3. ONE-PAGE REQUIREMENTS (CRITICAL - CV must fit on ONE page)
   - Target: Maximum 2-3 experiences, 3-5 projects (adjust to fit one page)
   - If content exceeds one page: prioritize by relevance and recency
   - MAXIMUM 3 bullets per experience (HARD LIMIT - condense if needed)
   - Each bullet must stay under 18 words for conciseness
   - Focus on impact and keywords, not length
   - Remove less relevant items to ensure one-page fit

4. EDUCATION CONDENSING (when applicable)
   - Detect overlapping years (e.g., "Sep 2023 - Aug 2025" and "Sep 2023 - Dec 2024")
   - IF same program/degree level with overlapping dates ‚Üí CONDENSE to 1 entry
   - IF Bachelor + Master (different periods) ‚Üí Keep separate
   - Combine: degrees, institutions, locations, descriptions
   - Use longest time span

PROCESS:
Step 1: Score experiences (0-10)
   - Technical alignment (0-4)
   - Domain alignment (0-3)
   - Recency (0-2): 2024-2025=2pts, 2022-2023=1pt, <2022=0pts
   - Impact (0-1)

Step 2: Score projects (0-10)
   - Technology overlap (0-5)
   - Problem domain (0-3)

   - Add keywords to descrition_list bullets naturally
   - Update skills arrays (max 10 per item, mixed placement)
   - EXACTLY 3 bullets per experience (‚â§18 words each, condensed with keywords)
   - DO NOT include experience.description field in output
   - Project descriptions must be max 35 words and favour metrics over narrative
   - Education descriptions: avoid forcing keywords, keep natural and relevant

Step 6: Build skills array (20-25 total)
   - Mix new keywords throughout (NOT at end)
   - Pattern: [orig, orig, NEW, orig, NEW, orig]

Step 7: Write summary (EXACTLY 2 sentences)
   - Include 3-4 critical keywords
   - Keep BOTH sentences under 18 words each (‚â§36 words total)
   - Focus on capabilities: "specializing in", "skilled in"
   - AVOID "experienced in" unless documented
